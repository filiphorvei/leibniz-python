# leibniz-python
A simple Python script to estimate  pi using the Madhava-Leibniz series. The user is prompted for the amount of terms to use in the calculation.
Please note that the Madhava-Leibniz series converges extremely slowly, so if you are interested in finding precise estimations of pi, I'd recommend just using Google :)
